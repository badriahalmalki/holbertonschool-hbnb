    C --> E
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G
```

### 3.2 Layer Responsibilities

#### 3.2.1 Presentation Layer

**Purpose**: Interface between external clients and the application

**Responsibilities**:
- Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing to appropriate business logic
- Response formatting (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Error handling and status code management

**Components**:
- RESTful API endpoints
- Request/response serializers
- Authentication middleware
- Route handlers

**Technology Considerations**:
- RESTful API design principles
- HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- JSON data format
- JWT or session-based authentication

#### 3.2.2 Business Logic Layer

**Purpose**: Core application logic and business rules

**Responsibilities**:
- Entity management (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- Business rule enforcement
- Data validation
- Relationship management
- Complex calculations (e.g., average ratings)
- State management

**Components**:
- Entity models (User, Place, Review, Amenity, PlaceAmenity)
- Business rule validators
- Service classes
- Facade pattern implementation

**Key Design Patterns**:
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interface for complex subsystems
- **Template Method**: BaseModel provides common functionality
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation methods

#### 3.2.3 Persistence Layer

**Purpose**: Data storage and retrieval

**Responsibilities**:
- Database connection management
- CRUD operations execution
- Query optimization
- Transaction management
- Data mapping (ORM)
- Connection pooling

**Components**:
- Database abstraction layer
- Repository pattern implementation
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) classes
- Database connection pool

**Future Implementation** (Part 3):
- Specific database selection (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Schema definition
- Migration scripts
- Indexing strategy

### 3.3 Facade Pattern Implementation

#### 3.3.1 What is the Facade Pattern?

The **Facade Pattern** provides a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem. In HBnB Evolution, the facade sits between the Presentation Layer and the Business Logic Layer, hiding the complexity of multiple models and business rules behind a clean API.

#### 3.3.2 Benefits

1. **Simplified Interface**: Presentation layer doesn't need to know about all business logic classes
2. **Loose Coupling**: Changes in business logic don't affect presentation layer
3. **Centralized Logic**: Common operations are centralized in one place
4. **Easier Testing**: Each layer can be tested independently
5. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined contracts between layers

#### 3.3.3 Example Facade Implementation

```python
class HBnBFacade:
    """
    Facade that provides simplified access to business logic layer
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_service = UserService()
        self.place_service = PlaceService()
        self.review_service = ReviewService()
        self.amenity_service = AmenityService()
    
    # User operations
    def register_user(self, user_data):
        """Register a new user"""
        return self.user_service.create_user(user_data)
    
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        """Retrieve user by ID"""
        return self.user_service.get_user(user_id)
    
    # Place operations
    def create_place(self, place_data, owner_id):
        """Create a new place listing"""
        owner = self.user_service.get_user(owner_id)
        return self.place_service.create_place(place_data, owner)
    
    def get_places_by_owner(self, owner_id):
        """Get all places owned by a user"""
        return self.place_service.get_by_owner(owner_id)
    
    # Review operations
    def submit_review(self, review_data, place_id, user_id):
        """Submit a review for a place"""
        place = self.place_service.get_place(place_id)
        user = self.user_service.get_user(user_id)
        return self.review_service.create_review(review_data, place, user)
    
    # Complex operations
    def get_place_with_details(self, place_id):
        """Get place with all related data"""
        place = self.place_service.get_place(place_id)
        amenities = self.amenity_service.get_by_place(place_id)
        reviews = self.review_service.get_by_place(place_id)
        avg_rating = self.review_service.calculate_average(place_id)
        
        return {
            'place': place,
            'amenities': amenities,
            'reviews': reviews,
            'average_rating': avg_rating
        }
```

### 3.4 Communication Flow

#### 3.4.1 Typical Request Flow

1. **Client** sends HTTP request to API endpoint
2. **Presentation Layer** receives and validates request
3. **Presentation Layer** calls **Facade** method
4. **Facade** orchestrates calls to appropriate **Business Logic** components
5. **Business Logic** validates data and enforces rules
6. **Business Logic** calls **Persistence Layer** for data operations
7. **Persistence Layer** executes database queries
8. **Response** flows back through layers to client

#### 3.4.2 Example: User Registration Flow

```
Client (POST /users)
    ↓
API Endpoint (validate request)
    ↓
Facade.register_user()
    ↓
UserService.create_user()
    ↓ (validate email, hash password)
User.save()
    ↓
UserRepository.insert()
    ↓
Database (INSERT query)
    ↓ (return user_id)
Response ← ← ← ← (201 Created + user data)
```

### 3.5 Architectural Decisions

#### 3.5.1 Why Three-Layer Architecture?

**Pros**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Independent layer testing
- ✅ Easier maintenance and updates
- ✅ Technology flexibility (can change database without affecting business logic)
- ✅ Team specialization (frontend vs backend vs database)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Slight overhead for simple operations
- ❌ More initial complexity

**Decision**: The benefits outweigh the costs for a project of this scale

#### 3.5.2 Why Facade Pattern?

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Direct access to business logic from presentation
2. Service layer without facade
3. Microservices architecture

**Decision Rationale**:
- Facade provides the right balance of simplicity and flexibility
- Easier to maintain than direct access
- Simpler than microservices for current scope
- Aligns with project requirements

## 4. Business Logic Layer

### 4.1 Overview

The Business Logic Layer is the heart of the HBnB Evolution application. It contains all entity models, business rules, validation logic, and relationship management. This layer is independent of both presentation and persistence, making it portable and testable.

### 4.2 Entity Models

#### 4.2.1 BaseModel (Abstract Class)

**Purpose**: Provides common functionality for all entities

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BaseModel {
        <<abstract>>
        -String id
        -DateTime created_at
        -DateTime updated_at
        +save() void
        +update() void
        +delete() void
        +to_dict() dict
        +__str__() String
    }
```

**Attributes**:
- `id (String)`: UUID4 unique identifier
- `created_at (DateTime)`: Timestamp of creation
- `updated_at (DateTime)`: Timestamp of last update

**Methods**:
- `save()`: Persists the entity to database
- `update()`: Updates timestamps and saves changes
- `delete()`: Removes entity from database
- `to_dict()`: Serializes entity to dictionary
- `__str__()`: Returns string representation

**Design Rationale**:
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminates code duplication across entities
- **Consistency**: Ensures all entities behave uniformly
- **Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality happen in one place
- **Audit Trail**: Automatic timestamp management

### 4.4 Relationships Explanation

#### 4.4.1 User → Place (One-to-Many, Composition)

**Relationship Type**: One-to-Many with Composition (strong ownership)

**Multiplicity**: 
- One User can own zero or more Places (1:0..*)
- Each Place is owned by exactly one User (1:1)

**Meaning**:
- Users are property owners who list their places
- A place cannot exist without an owner
- When a user account is deleted, their places must be handled (reassign, delete, or flag)

**Implementation**:
- Place entity has `owner_id` foreign key referencing User
- User has method `get_owned_places()` to retrieve their listings

**Business Implications**:
- Owners can create, update, and delete their own places
- Owners receive notifications for bookings and reviews
- Admins can view all places regardless of owner

#### 4.4.2 User → Review (One-to-Many)

**Relationship Type**: One-to-Many Association

**Multiplicity**:
- One User can write zero or more Reviews (1:0..*)
- Each Review is written by exactly one User (1:1)

**Meaning**:
- Users provide feedback on places they've visited
- Reviews are attributed to specific users for credibility

**Implementation**:
- Review entity has `user_id` foreign key referencing User
- User has method `get_reviews()` to retrieve their reviews

**Business Implications**:
- Users build reputation through quality reviews
- Users can edit/delete their own reviews
- Review history is preserved even if place is deleted

#### 4.4.3 Place → Review (One-to-Many, Composition)

**Relationship Type**: One-to-Many with Composition

**Multiplicity**:
- One Place can receive zero or more Reviews (1:0..*)
- Each Review is about exactly one Place (1:1)

**Meaning**:
- Places accumulate reviews over time
- Reviews are dependent on the place existing
- If a place is deleted, its reviews should be handled appropriately

**Implementation**:
- Review entity has `place_id` foreign key referencing Place
- Place has method `get_reviews()` to retrieve all reviews
- Place has method `calculate_average_rating()` using reviews

**Business Implications**:
- Reviews influence place popularity and bookings
- Average rating is calculated from all reviews
- Recent reviews may be weighted more heavily (future enhancement)

#### 4.4.4 Place ↔ Amenity (Many-to-Many)

**Relationship Type**: Many-to-Many Association

**Multiplicity**:
- One Place can have zero or more Amenities (0..*:0..*)
- One Amenity can be associated with zero or more Places (0..*:0..*)

**Meaning**:
- Places can offer various amenities (WiFi, Pool, etc.)
- Amenities are reusable across multiple places
- A standard amenity catalog simplifies searching

**Implementation**:
- PlaceAmenity association table with `place_id` and `amenity_id`
- Place has methods `add_amenity()` and `remove_amenity()`
- Amenity has method `get_places()` to find all places with that amenity

**Business Implications**:
- Users can search for places by amenity
- Amenities can be standardized for consistency
- New amenities can be added without affecting existing places
- Removing an amenity from a place doesn't delete the amenity from the system

### 4.5 SOLID Principles Application

#### 4.5.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change

**Application**:
- **User**: Manages only user-related operations (registration, authentication, profile)
- **Place**: Manages only property-related operations (listing, updating, amenity associations)
- **Review**: Manages only review operations (creation, updates, validation)
- **Amenity**: Manages only amenity operations (creation, updates, associations)
- **PlaceAmenity**: Manages only place-amenity associations

**Benefits**:
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Changes in one entity don't affect others
- Simpler testing with focused test cases

#### 4.5.2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Definition**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

**Application**:
- **BaseModel** provides extensibility through inheritance
- New entity types can be added by inheriting from BaseModel
- Existing entities don't need modification when new features are added
- New methods can be added to entities without changing existing code

**Example**:
```python
# Future extension: Add Booking entity
class Booking(BaseModel):
    # Inherits id, created_at, updated_at
    # Adds booking-specific attributes and methods
    pass
```

#### 4.5.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Definition**: Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes

**Application**:
- All entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity) inherit from BaseModel
- Any code that works with BaseModel will work with any entity
- Common methods (save, update, delete) behave consistently
- Polymorphism enables generic operations on all entities

**Example**:
```python
def save_entity(entity: BaseModel):
    # Works with User, Place, Review, or Amenity
    entity.save()
```

#### 4.5.4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use

**Application**:
- Each entity exposes only methods relevant to its functionality
- User has authentication methods; Place does not
- Place has coordinate validation; User does not
- No "god class" with all possible methods

**Benefits**:
- Clearer interfaces
- Easier to understand what each entity can do
- Reduced coupling between entities

#### 4.5.5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Definition**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

**Application**:
- Entities depend on BaseModel abstraction
- Business logic depends on repository interfaces (to be implemented in persistence layer)
- Facade depends on service interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Enables easy testing with mocks and stubs

**Example**:
```python
# High-level module depends on abstraction
class PlaceService:
    def __init__(self, repository: IPlaceRepository):
        self.repository = repository  # Interface, not concrete class
```

### 4.6 Design Patterns Used

#### 4.6.1 Template Method Pattern

**Pattern**: BaseModel defines the template for all entities

**Implementation**:
- BaseModel provides common methods (save, update, delete)
- Subclasses can override or extend these methods
- Ensures consistent behavior across all entities

**Benefits**:
- Code reuse
- Consistency
- Easier maintenance

#### 4.6.2 Factory Pattern

**Pattern**: Entity creation methods act as factories

**Implementation**:
- `User.register()` creates User instances
- `Place.create_place()` creates Place instances
- `Review.create_review()` creates Review instances

**Benefits**:
- Centralized creation logic
- Ensures proper initialization
- Can add validation and business rules

#### 4.6.3 Repository Pattern (Future)

**Pattern**: Abstracts data persistence operations

**Implementation** (Part 3):
- UserRepository for User data operations
- PlaceRepository for Place data operations
- Separates business logic from data access

**Benefits**:
- Testability (can mock repositories)
- Database independence
- Centralized query logic

## 5. API Interaction Flow

### 5.1 Overview

This section presents sequence diagrams for four critical API operations. These diagrams illustrate the interaction between the Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer (via Facade), and Persistence Layer, showing how data flows through the system.

### 5.2 Sequence Diagram 1: User Registration

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/users/register`

**Purpose**: Allow new users to create an account

**Flow Description**:
1. Client sends POST request with user data (first_name, last_name, email, password)
2. API validates request format and required fields
3. Facade receives registration request
4. Business Logic checks if email already exists
5. If email is unique, password is hashed
6. User entity is created and saved to database
7. Success response with user ID is returned

## 6. Design Decisions and Rationale

### 6.1 Technology-Agnostic Design

**Decision**: The architecture is designed to be independent of specific technologies

**Rationale**:
- Allows flexibility in choosing programming languages, frameworks, and databases in implementation phases
- Focuses on architectural patterns and business logic rather than technology constraints
- Makes the design transferable across different tech stacks
- Reduces the risk of premature optimization

**Implications**:
- Part 2 will specify concrete technologies (Python/Flask, Node.js/Express, etc.)
- Part 3 will specify database technology (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Current design principles remain valid regardless of implementation choices

### 6.2 UUID4 for Entity Identification

**Decision**: Use UUID4 (Universally Unique Identifiers) instead of auto-incrementing integers

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Auto-incrementing integers (1, 2, 3, ...)
2. Composite keys
3. Natural keys (e.g., email for users)

**Rationale for UUID4**:
- ✅ **Global Uniqueness**: No collision risk across distributed systems or databases
- ✅ **Security**: IDs are not predictable or guessable
- ✅ **Scalability**: Can be generated independently without coordination
- ✅ **Data Migration**: No ID conflicts when merging databases
- ✅ **Privacy**: Doesn't reveal information about number of users/places

**Trade-offs**:
- ❌ Slightly larger storage size (128 bits vs 32/64 bits)
- ❌ Not human-readable
- ❌ No inherent ordering

**Conclusion**: Benefits outweigh drawbacks for a scalable web application

### 6.3 Audit Trail (created_at, updated_at)

**Decision**: All entities track creation and modification timestamps

**Rationale**:
- **Compliance**: Required for many regulations (GDPR, audit trails)
- **Debugging**: Helps trace when issues occurred
- **Analytics**: Understand user behavior and system usage patterns
- **Dispute Resolution**: Timestamp evidence for review submissions, bookings, etc.
- **Data Integrity**: Detect and investigate suspicious modifications

**Implementation**:
- Timestamps automatically set by BaseModel
- `created_at`: Set once during entity creation
- `updated_at`: Updated every time entity is modified
- Timestamps are immutable (cannot be manually changed)

### 6.4 Password Hashing

**Decision**: Never store plain-text passwords; always hash with strong algorithms

**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Protects users even if database is compromised
- **Best Practice**: Industry standard for authentication systems
- **Legal Requirement**: Many jurisdictions require secure password storage
- **User Trust**: Demonstrates commitment to security

**Implementation Guidelines** (Part 2):
- Use bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2
- Include salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
- Use sufficient work factor (computational cost)
- Never log passwords or include in error messages

### 6.5 Many-to-Many with Association Class

**Decision**: Implement Place-Amenity relationship using PlaceAmenity association class

**Alternative**: Direct many-to-many without association class

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Can add metadata (when amenity was added, who added it)
- **Audit Trail**: Track changes to place amenities
- **Future-Proof**: Easier to extend with additional fields
- **Performance**: Can optimize queries more effectively

**Example Future Enhancements**:
- `added_by_user_id`: Track who added the amenity
- `verified`: Boolean flag for amenity verification
- `condition_notes`: Additional details about the amenity

### 6.6 Composition vs. Aggregation

**Decision**: Use composition for User-Place and Place-Review relationships

**Rationale**:

**User → Place (Composition)**:
- Places have strong ownership by users
- A place's lifecycle is tied to its owner
- When deleting a user, places must be handled (reassign or delete)

**Place → Review (Composition)**:
- Reviews are intrinsically linked to places
- A review without a place has no meaning
- When deleting a place, reviews should be deleted or archived

**Place ↔ Amenity (Aggregation)**:
- Amenities exist independently of places
- Deleting a place doesn't delete amenities
- Amenities can be shared across many places

### 6.7 Validation in Business Logic Layer

**Decision**: Perform data validation in the business logic layer, not just at presentation

**Rationale**:
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation
- **Reusability**: Validation logic isn't duplicated across different API clients
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures business rules are enforced regardless of entry point
- **Testability**: Can test business rules independently

**Examples**:
- Email format validation in User entity
- Price > 0 validation in Place entity
- Rating 1-5 validation in Review entity
- Coordinate range validation in Place entity

### 6.8 Facade Pattern for Layer Communication

**Decision**: Use Facade pattern between Presentation and Business Logic layers

**Alternative**: Allow direct access to multiple business logic classes

**Rationale**:
- **Simplified Interface**: Presentation layer has single point of contact
- **Loose Coupling**: Changes in business logic don't ripple to presentation
- **Centralized Logic**: Common operations are in one place
- **Easier Testing**: Can mock facade for presentation layer tests
- **Clear Contracts**: Well-defined boundaries between layers

### 6.9 RESTful API Design

**Decision**: Use REST principles for API design

**Principles Applied**:
- Resources identified by URIs (`/users`, `/places`, `/reviews`)
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Stateless communication
- JSON data format
- Appropriate status codes

**Benefits**:
- **Industry Standard**: Familiar to most developers
- **Tooling**: Extensive tooling and libraries available
- **Scalability**: Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- **Caching**: HTTP caching mechanisms work out-of-the-box

### 6.10 Pagination for List Endpoints

**Decision**: Implement pagination for endpoints that return lists

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Prevent loading thousands of records at once
- **User Experience**: Faster initial page loads
- **Bandwidth**: Reduces data transfer
- **Scalability**: System remains responsive as data grows

**Implementation**:
- `limit`: Number of results per page
- `offset`: Starting position
- `total`: Total count for UI pagination

- Write documentation
- Conduct security review

### 7.2 Coding Standards

#### 7.2.1 Naming Conventions

**Classes**: PascalCase
```python
class User:
class Place:
class ReviewService:
```

**Methods and Functions**: snake_case
```python
def register_user():
def calculate_average_rating():
def get_owned_places():
```

**Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
```python
MAX_RATING = 5
MIN_RATING = 1
DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE = 10
```

**Private Attributes**: Prefix with underscore
```python
self._password_hash
self._internal_cache
```

#### 7.2.2 Documentation

**All classes should have docstrings**:
```python
class User(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents a user in the HBnB system.
    
    Users can be property owners or guests. They can register,
    authenticate, manage profiles, and interact with places and reviews.
    
    Attributes:
        first_name (str): User's first name
        last_name (str): User's last name
        email (str): Unique email address
        password (str): Hashed password
        is_admin (bool): Administrator flag
    """
```

**All public methods should have docstrings**:
```python
def register(first_name, last_name, email, password):
    """
    Create a new user account.
    
    Args:
        first_name (str): User's first name
        last_name (str): User's last name
        email (str): Valid email address
        password (str): Plain-text password (will be hashed)
    
    Returns:
        User: Newly created user object
    
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If email is invalid or already exists
        ValueError: If password doesn't meet requirements
    """
```

### 7.3 Testing Strategy

#### 7.3.1 Unit Tests

**Test each entity independently**:
- BaseModel tests (UUID generation, timestamps)
- User tests (registration, authentication, validation)
- Place tests (creation, coordinate validation, amenity management)
- Review tests (rating validation, associations)
- Amenity tests (name uniqueness, associations)

**Example Test Structure**:
```python
class TestUser(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_register_creates_user_with_valid_data(self):
        # Test user registration with valid input
        
    def test_register_raises_error_for_duplicate_email(self):
        # Test duplicate email is rejected
        
    def test_authenticate_with_correct_password(self):
        # Test successful authentication
        
    def test_authenticate_fails_with_wrong_password(self):
        # Test failed authentication
```

#### 7.3.2 Integration Tests

**Test interactions between components**:
- User registration → Database persistence
- Place creation → Owner validation → Database save
- Review submission → Rating calculation update
- Place listing → Amenity loading → Response formatting

#### 7.3.3 API Tests

**Test complete request/response cycles**:
- POST /users/register with valid/invalid data
- GET /places with various query parameters
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Error handling and status codes

### 7.4 Security Considerations

#### 7.4.1 Authentication and Authorization

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or secure session management
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**Authorization Rules**:
- Users can only modify their own profiles
- Users can only delete their own reviews
- Only place owners can update/delete their places
- Admins have elevated privileges for moderation

#### 7.4.2 Input Validation

**Always validate and sanitize user input**:
- Reject malformed requests
- Validate data types and formats
- Check for SQL injection attempts
- Sanitize HTML/JavaScript in user-generated content
- Validate file uploads (if implemented)

#### 7.4.3 Password Security

**Password Requirements**:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Not in common password dictionary
- Not same as email or name

**Storage**:
- Hash with bcrypt or Argon2
- Use sufficient work factor (cost parameter)
- Include salt automatically
- Never log passwords

#### 7.4.4 Rate Limiting

**Implement rate limits to prevent abuse**:
- API calls: 100 requests per minute per IP
- Login attempts: 5 failed attempts → temporary lockout
- Registration: 3 accounts per IP per day

### 7.5 Performance Optimization

#### 7.5.1 Database Queries

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use indexes on frequently queried fields (email, place_id, user_id)
- Implement database connection pooling
- Use lazy loading for related entities
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

**Example Indexes**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_place_owner ON places(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_review_place ON reviews(place_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_review_user ON reviews(user_id);
```

#### 7.5.2 Caching Strategy

**Cache candidates**:
- User profile data
- Place details
- Average ratings
- Amenity list

**Cache invalidation**:
- Clear user cache on profile update
- Clear place cache on place update or new review
- Clear rating cache on review create/update/delete

#### 7.5.3 Pagination

**Always paginate list endpoints**:
- Default page size: 10-20 items
- Maximum page size: 100 items
- Provide total count for UI pagination
- Use offset + limit or cursor-based pagination

### 7.6 Error Handling

#### 7.6.1 Error Response Format

**Consistent error structure**:
```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message",
  "code": "MACHINE_READABLE_CODE",
  "field": "field_name",  // For validation errors
  "details": {}           // Additional context
}
```

#### 7.6.2 Logging

**Log all errors with context**:
- Timestamp
- User ID (if applicable)
- Request ID for tracing
- Stack trace
- Request parameters (excluding sensitive data)

**Log Levels**:
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information
- **INFO**: General informational messages
- **WARNING**: Warning messages (e.g., deprecated API usage)
- **ERROR**: Error messages (recoverable errors)
- **CRITICAL**: Critical errors (system failures)

### 7.7 Code Review Checklist
